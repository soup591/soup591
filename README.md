- 👋 Hi, I’m @soup591 (Ryan !)
- 👀 I’m interested in creating unique, personal projects which allow me to improve my abilities while being extremely engaging.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 3 with various frameworks (including but not limited to Flask, Django, etc), SQL / Oracle, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with other dedicated learners and improve out abilities together!
