- Hi, I’m Ryan (@soup591)
- I’m currently interested in creating unique, personal projects which allow me to improve my abilities while being extremely engaging. In addition, I am also interested in continuing to improve my data structures and algorithm knowledge by pairing with programmers to complete challenges on sites such as "Code Wars" and "Leet Code".
- I’m currently polishing my Python 3 skills, completing IBM's 11-month "Full-Stack Cloud Development" MicroBachelors program, learning server-side JavaScript with Node.js, solidifying my base knowledge of HTML, CSS and front-end JavaScript, and creating fun and interactive web apps while challenging myself to explore the extremely vast but mesmerizing world of programming every day.
- If I am not pulling, updating/modifying, pushing and committing changes to projects I have created here, directly on GitHub, you can usually find me on Codecademy.
